# TweetvsRetweet
This is implementation of vaccine sentiment classification by evaluating  two different kinds of tweets  (original tweets and retweets). I tried to study how the comment and original tweets impacts the sentiment. Thus, I implemented GAN to generate representations for retweet similar to original tweets and vice-versa.
